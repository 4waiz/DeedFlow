# DeedFlow 🏡⚖️  
**AI-powered transaction orchestration for fractional & tokenized real estate (UAE-ready).**  
Think **TurboTax + DocuSign + compliance ops + settlement gating** — built for high-stakes property workflows like fractional ownership, tokenization pilots, and asset management.

---

## TL;DR (One-liner)
**DeedFlow turns complex fractional/tokenized property deals into a guided, compliant, step-by-step workflow with an audit trail and post-sale automation (51% control rule, rent distribution, maintenance).**

---

## Why this matters (Problem)
Fractional/tokenized real estate sounds simple, but the *real transaction* is messy and high-risk:

- Document collection + verification (IDs, title deed, KYC/AML)
- Approvals / NOCs
- Valuation refresh & pricing updates
- Escrow + settlement steps
- Post-sale ops: rent distribution, maintenance responsibility, management handover
- Governance rules: e.g. **51% majority buyer controls management decisions**

People drop off because it’s confusing, slow, and stressful.

---

## What DeedFlow does (Solution)
DeedFlow is a **workflow agent** that orchestrates the deal end-to-end:

✅ Creates a fractional listing (splits into shares / tokens)  
✅ Generates a compliance checklist with “why it matters” explanations  
✅ Collects & validates docs (mocked for demo)  
✅ Enforces settlement gates (can’t close until required steps are green)  
✅ Produces an audit trail for compliance review  
✅ Automates post-close logic (rent + maintenance + governance)

## Core Features
### 1) “Deal Cockpit” workflow timeline
A guided checklist like:

1. Identity + KYC/AML  
2. Title deed verification  
3. Required NOCs / approvals  
4. Valuation refresh  
5. Escrow + settlement  
6. Share/token issuance + cap table  
7. Post-close: rent + maintenance + governance

### 2) Document vault + extraction (demo)
Upload a mock document → system extracts key fields and flags missing items.

### 3) Settlement gating (compliance-first)
A deal can only move to “Ready to settle” when required steps are satisfied.

### 4) Governance logic (51% rule)
If a buyer (or coalition) crosses **51%**, the system routes control/management decisions accordingly.

### 5) Post-close automation
- Rent distribution (pro-rata)
- Maintenance responsibility logic
- Decision workflow & audit logging

## Target Users
- Developers launching fractional units
- Tokenization platforms
- Asset managers & family offices
- Government / pilot partners

## Demo Walkthrough (2–3 mins)
Use this exact flow in your Loom:

1. **Create a fractional listing**  
   - Set splits (e.g. 100 shares)  
   - Enable **51% majority control rule**

2. **Show the workflow cockpit**  
   - Explain “missing items” + why they matter

3. **Upload a mock doc**  
   - Show extracted fields + compliance flags

4. **Settlement gate**  
   - Show “can’t close until compliant”

5. **Post-close panel**  
   - Rent distribution + maintenance + governance

## Hackathon Mode Notes
- Demo uses **synthetic data** (mock docs, simulated steps).  
- Built to be “API-ready” for real integrations next:
  - Identity/KYC providers
  - Government approvals / NOC systems
  - Payment rails / escrow providers
  - Tokenization issuance + custody platforms

---

## Architecture (Simple)
- **Frontend:** Deal dashboard + workflow timeline + document vault  
- **Orchestration layer:** Rules engine + agent prompts to guide steps  
- **Audit log:** Every action + decision recorded for compliance review  
- **(Demo) Mock connectors:** Simulated verification & approvals

---

## Future Roadmap
- Real KYC/AML + document verification integrations
- e-signature + regulator-ready compliance reports
- Live settlement rails + escrow provider integration
- On-chain/off-chain cap table sync + custody integrations
- Multi-language (EN/AR) for UAE workflows
